# Unweighted-4.0-GPA-Scale-to-Percentage-Grades

This script converts scores with Unweighted 4.0 GPA Scale to Percentage Grades in the desired Excel Workbook.

Note:
•	The script utilizes the pandas library. Therefore, make sure you have the pandas library installed.
•	The script does not look for the data in a specific column or row and instead looks for the entire workbook. Therefore, make sure that in the workbook you would like to work on, only the GPAs you want to convert are present as numbers. You can modify it further to only look for the data in a given column using the pandas library if you wish to do so.
